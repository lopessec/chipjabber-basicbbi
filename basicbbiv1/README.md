### Custom Coil Winding

The "heart" of BasicBBI is a custom wound coil. This coil is surprisingly uncritical how you wind it, but you've got to do it. The suggested coil is based on these parts:

* Fair-Rite rod [3061990871](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/fair-rite-products-corp/3061990871/8599472)
* 26 AWG, and 30 AWG magnetic wire, available in [Sparkfun PRT-11363](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/PRT-11363/5230957)

Optionally, you may find some Super-Glue + Accelerator/Activator convenient to freeze your windings in place. 

To wind the coil:

1. Wind 6 turns of 26 AWG magnet wire, this is the primary.
2. Use some glue (the super-glue + accelerator is easiest here) to hold the winding in place.
3. Wind 60 turns of the 30 AWG magnet wire on-top. You'll have to go back and forth several times. It can be fairly messy and still seems to work fine.

Leave lots of spare wire, as you can tin the wires once you see how it fits onto the PCB.
